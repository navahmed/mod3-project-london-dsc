# Module 3 Project - Seattle Terry Stops Arrest Predictor

## Background - 

A Terry Stop allows the police in USA to detain an individual based on 'reasonable suspicion' of involvement in criminal activity. The legal standard for arrests and warrants in the United States is probable cause. Reasonable suspicion is less than probable cause, and is more like an "inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or 'hunch". Reasonable suspicion must be based on "specific and articulable facts", "taken together with rational inferences from those facts",[2] and the suspicion must be associated with the specific individual.

Terry Stops originated from a landmark Supreme Court case in 1969, 'Terry vs Ohio.' A police officer in Cleveland, Ohio detained 3 men on the premise that they were behaving suspiciously. The officer believed that the men were preparing for armed robbery. The officer detained the men, and conducted a pat down search, and retrieved a fire arm. 2 of the men were convicted of carrying a concealed weapon. This case was appealed to the Supreme Court, with the convicted arguing that the weapon was found during an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment states "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." The court found that the detention was admissible as the officer had reasonable suspicion which could be articulated - that the individuals detained could be armed and dangerous. 

## Project Objective - 

The objective of this project is to try to predict whether a Terry Stop will result in an arrest. The dataset that we will use for this is Terry Stop data from Seattle, Washington between 2015 until 2020. It is a binary classification problem, and using the data we will look to create a prediction model based on the avaiable data to determine whether an individual is arrested or not during a Terry Stop.
